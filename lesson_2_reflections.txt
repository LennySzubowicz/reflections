How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value
do you think it offers?

    The staging area contains files that you intend to include in your next commit.
    You can incrementally add files to the staging area.
    This allows you to keep files in your working directory that are not tracked by Git
    because all files are not automatically included in your commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

    You can add the file to the staging area as soon as you have completed a logical
    change even if you are not ready to commit it yet and you wish to keep working.
    You can also use the git diff --staged command to review the contents of the
    staged change before you commit it.
