How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value
do you think it offers?

    The staging area contains files that you intend to include in your next commit.
    You can incrementally add files to the staging area.
    This allows you to keep files in your working directory that are not tracked by Git
    because all files are not automatically included in your commits.
