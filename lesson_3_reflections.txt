When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You would want to use a remote repository if multiple people are
    contributing to that repository or if you expect to contribute from more
    than one system. Another benefit of a remote repository is that it's an
    off-site backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You probably wouldn't want git to automatically modify your local
    repository by doing a pull without your consent. It's possible that you
    are actively working with the contents of your local git repository as it
    is. In addition, you could have multiple remote repositories and multiple
    remote branches in each. Should git automatically pull all, or some subset?
    The simplest approach is to have you decide when and what you want to pull.
